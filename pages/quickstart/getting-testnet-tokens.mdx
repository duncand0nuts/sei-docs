# Getting Testnet Sei Tokens

### Faucets

Faucets dispensing small amounts of tokens for development/testing are available on both the public testnet (atlantic-2) and devnet (arctic-1).

These tokens bear no value, however please utilize small amounts when possible, as the supplied amounts are limited and the faucets all Discord-gated (unless specified).
